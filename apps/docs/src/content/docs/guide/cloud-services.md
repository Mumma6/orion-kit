## Integration Benefits

### Why Use These Services?

**Instead of building yourself:**

- üöÄ **Faster time to market** - Focus on your product
- üîí **Better security** - Battle-tested by thousands of apps
- üí∞ **Lower cost** - Cheaper than engineering time
- üìà **Better features** - More features than you'd build
- üõ†Ô∏è **Less maintenance** - No infrastructure to manage

**Production-ready:**

- ‚úÖ SOC 2 compliance (most services)
- ‚úÖ 99.9%+ uptime
- ‚úÖ Automatic backups
- ‚úÖ DDoS protection
- ‚úÖ Global CDN

### Cost vs. Build Yourself

Building authentication alone would take:

- 2-4 weeks of development
- Security audits
- Ongoing maintenance
- Testing across devices/browsers
- **Total cost:** $10k-20k+

Using Clerk:

- 10 minutes to integrate
- $0-25/month
- **Total cost:** $25/month

## Free Tier Limits

All services can handle significant traffic on free tiers:

**Clerk:** 10,000 MAU = ~50-100 new signups/day  
**Neon:** 0.5GB = ~50,000 rows  
**Axiom:** 500MB = ~5M log entries  
**PostHog:** 1M events = ~1,000 DAU with good tracking  
**Trigger.dev:** 100k runs = ~3,000 jobs/day

For most new projects, free tiers last 6-12 months.

## Migrating Later

All services support data export:

- **Clerk** ‚Üí Export users via API
- **Neon** ‚Üí Standard Postgres dump
- **Axiom** ‚Üí Export logs as JSON
- **PostHog** ‚Üí Export events via API
- **Trigger.dev** ‚Üí Self-host option available

No vendor lock-in.

## Self-Hosting Options

Some services can be self-hosted if needed:

- **Auth:** NextAuth.js (open source)
- **Database:** Self-hosted Postgres
- **Logging:** Self-hosted Loki or OpenObserve
- **Analytics:** Self-hosted PostHog
- **Jobs:** Self-hosted Trigger.dev

But we recommend cloud services for:

- Less maintenance
- Better reliability
- Automatic updates
- Professional support

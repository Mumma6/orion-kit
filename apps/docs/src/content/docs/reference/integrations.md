# Integration Guides

Orion Kit is intentionally minimal. Add features as needed:

| Feature                                                  | When to Add               | Difficulty |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- |
| **[AI Features](/reference/integrations/ai)**            | Chat, text generation     | ⭐⭐⭐     |
| **[Email](/reference/integrations/email)**               | Onboarding, notifications | ⭐⭐       |
| **[i18n](/reference/integrations/i18n)**                 | Multi-language support    | ⭐⭐⭐     |
| **[File Uploads](/reference/integrations/file-uploads)** | Avatars, documents        | ⭐⭐       |
| **[CMS](/reference/integrations/cms)**                   | Blog, marketing content   | ⭐⭐⭐     |
| **[Real-time](/reference/integrations/realtime)**        | Chat, live updates        | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   |
| **[Search](/reference/integrations/search)**             | Full-text search          | ⭐⭐⭐     |

## Philosophy

**Start minimal, add only what you need.** Every integration adds complexity, dependencies, and costs.
